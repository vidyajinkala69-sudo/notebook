    "1. Basics of Probability: Coin Toss and Dice Roll\n",
    "Coin Toss: The program simulates tossing a fair coin 10,000 times using Python’s random.choice to select 'Heads' or 'Tails'. It counts the occurrences of each outcome and computes their experimental probabilities by dividing by the total number of tosses. The expected probabilities are approximately 0.5 for both heads and tails.\n",
    "Dice Roll: The program simulates rolling two fair six-sided dice 10,000 times. For each roll, it checks if the sum is 7 and calculates the probability as the proportion of successful rolls. The theoretical probability of a sum of 7 is 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.\n",
    "2. Probability of At Least One \"6\"\n",
    "This function simulates rolling a fair die 10 times per trial for 10,000 trials. It checks if at least one roll in each trial results in a 6 and computes the proportion of trials with at least one 6. The theoretical probability can be calculated as (1 - (5/6)^{10}), and the simulation approximates this value.\n",
    "3. Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "Conditional Probability: The program simulates drawing a ball (with replacement) from a bag with 5 red, 7 green, and 8 blue balls 1,000 times. It tracks sequences where a blue ball is followed by a red ball to estimate P(Red|Previous Blue).\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem: The program calculates P(Red),P(Blue), P(Red|Blue), and P(Blue|Red) from the simulation and verifies Bayes' theorem by checking if P(Red).P(Blue|Red) \\approx P(Blue).P(Red|Blue). The theoretical probability of drawing a red ball is 5/20 = 0.25, and the conditional probability depends on the simulation data.\n",
    "5. Discrete Random Variable\n",
    "The program generates 1,000 samples from a discrete random variable with values 1, 2, and 3 and probabilities 0.25, 0.35, and 0.4, respectively, using numpy.random.choice. It computes the empirical mean, variance, and standard deviation using NumPy’s built-in functions. These values approximate the theoretical mean (\\(0.25(1 + 0.35 \\cdot 2 + 0.4 \\cdot 3 = 2.15\\)) and variance.\n",
    "6. Continuous Random Variable: Exponential Distribution\n",
    "The program generates 2,000 samples from an exponential distribution with a mean of 5 using numpy.random.exponential. It visualizes the samples with a histogram and overlays the theoretical PDF using scipy.stats.expon. The histogram approximates the shape of the exponential distribution, with the PDF showing the expected density curve.\n",
    "7. Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "The program generates 10,000 random numbers from a uniform distribution (0, 1) and draws 1,000 samples of size 30. It calculates the mean of each sample and plots the distribution of these sample means alongside the population’s uniform distribution. The sample means form a bell-shaped curve, illustrating the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches normality as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution."
